# Join Dots

Connect-Four style game "Join Dots" â€” Human (red) vs Claude (yellow).

Features implemented:
- React + Vite app skeleton
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- 6x7 board, smooth drop animation, last move ring, pulsing win highlight
- Difficulty selection (easy, medium, hard)
- AI integration that tries to call `window.claude.complete` (if available) and falls back to a local AI
- AI thinking panel showing ASCII board and move history
- Animated gradient background orbs and glassmorphism panels

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes
- To enable Claude integration, expose a global `window.claude.complete` function that accepts an object with `prompt` and returns an object containing `.output.text` with a JSON object like {"col":2, "thoughts":[...]}. The app falls back to local AI if Claude is unavailable.
- This is a front-end-only implementation; no server required.
# Join Dots - Connect Four AI Game

A visually stunning Connect Four game featuring AI-powered opponent Claude with three difficulty levels.

## Features

### Core Game Mechanics

  - Hover effects showing where pieces will drop

### AI Integration (Claude)
- **Three Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Easy**: Claude plays casually, makes random moves, doesn't always block wins

- **Move Analysis**: Displays threats, strategy, and reasoning for each AI move
- **Round Tracking**: All AI moves logged with round numbers

### UI/UX Design
- **Modern Dark Theme**: Gradient backgrounds with blue/slate tones
- **Animated Background**: Floating gradient orbs (purple, blue, pink)
- **Glassmorphism Effects**: Translucent panels with blur effects
- **Smooth Animations**: All interactions have polished transitions
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Red pieces: Red/pink gradients with glow
  - Yellow pieces: Yellow/orange gradients with glow
- **Responsive Layout**: Game board on left, AI panel on right

## AI Implementation

The AI uses `window.claude.complete` API with different strategies:

- **Easy**: Temperature 0.8, casual play, random moves
- **Medium**: Temperature 0.5, balanced strategy
- **Hard**: Temperature 0.3, optimal play with minimax-like thinking

Fallback AI is included if Claude API is unavailable.
